            </h1>
            <p>
              Revise your Assignment #8 Experimental Camera by adding a consentful
              interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gaining access to the user’s webcam is a sensitive topic and should be
              dealt with care, because capturing is a form of seeing, and seeing can
              either empower or disempower the user in front of the webcam (e.g. CCTV cameras hidden throughout the city and gather pedestrian's data is a bold example that invades privacy and violates consent). 
              <br /><br />
              For Assignment #9, you will duplicate your Experimental Camera
              sketch, revise the camera features as needed, then follow the F.R.I.E.S model from  <a
                href="https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf"
                
                >Consentful Tech Zine</a
              > to add a consentful interface.
              Being able to design and code is powerful, so please put great considerations into how you’re navigating consent
              with your user at every step of the way. Search for clear and creative ways to disclose information to your user, and aim to communicate consent in a way
              that is safe, thoughtful, and full of care.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Use the F.R.I.E.S. model as a reference to design a consentful interface
                for your Experimental Camera. Draw a <a href="https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/flowchart-guide-flowchart-tutorial/">flowchart</a> on the computer or on a piece of paper that clearly outlines
                the new architecture for your camera software. Rehearse the
                scenarios over and over again until there are no holes left – the devil is all in the details
                here!
              </li>
              <li>
                Once your flowchart is completed, sketch out the visual design for your
                interface. You are required to use one or more of the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM">p5 DOM
                elements</a> to create your interface.

                You will present your flowchart and sketches in Lab, then you will
                revise and polish your ideas based on feedback from CC faculty and

              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer your flowchart and sketch into the p5 sketch. Ask your
                friend(s) to try out your Experimental Camera 2.0. to make sure that
                you’re getting your points across.
