          Critical Computation Lecture + Lab (CC Lecture + CC Lab) are
          corequisites that work hand-in-hand to introduce computation and code
          as an expressive medium for artists, designers, and technologists. CC
          Lecture provides an introduction to computation through a series of
          critical inquiries and technical fundamentals, while CC Lab serves as
          a continuum of CC Lecture by applying theories to practice through a
          series of experimentations and play. Together, the three learning
          pillars for CC Lecture + CC Lab are code, critique, and design.
          <br />
          <br />
          CC Lecture provides a critical approach to thinking and working with
          technology by introducing programming concepts within a social and
          historical context. Through an intersectional feminist lens, the
          course unpacks design biases embedded in pervasive technology while
          pointing towards examples of expressive, critical, and
          community-centric ways of working with technology. On the technical
          end, the course introduces programming fundamentals through p5.js,
          followed by examples of additional JavaScript libraries and external
          APIs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lab expands the topics covered in CC Lecture through extended
          tutorials, pair-programming sessions, embodied group activities, and
          one-on-one mentoring. The lab structure allows students to process the
          course materials and Assignments assigned by CC Lecture, and further
          develop the assignments based on their own individual interests and
          background.

          Critical Computation is a community of learners interested in
          exploring the creation of art and design with technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every
          gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,
          language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture,
          subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and
          background. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect
          self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
          <br />
          <br />
          We like these hashtags: <b>#noCodeSnobs</b> (because we value
          community over efficiency), <b>#newKidLove</b> (because we all started

          and <b>#BlackLivesMatter</b> (because of course).

        <p>
          A collaborative effort between students and the CC Lecture + Lab
          faculty is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While
          everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually,
          if a class member points out that something you have said or shared
          with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach
          the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from
          one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in
          discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are
          encouraged to speak with one of the CC faculty or the MFADT director
          John Sharp.

            Land Acknowledgement
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          We would like to acknowledge the Lenni-Lenape people who are the
          original inhabitants of Lenapehoking and the island of Mannahatta. The
          land The New School University is built upon, including all of New
          York City, present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the
          Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson
          Valley, comprise Lenape ancestral homeland. This land was not ceded
          nor sold, as folklore would have us believe, to the Dutch for beads
          and trinkets.
          <br />
          <br />
          This land was forcibly taken through occupation by European settlers,
          resulting in displacement, forced migration, and genocide. In the
          present day there are Lenape communities throughout North America,
          though much of the original Lenape territory remains under settler
          occupation and control.
          <br />
          <br />
          As settlers who have benefitted from the colonization of sovereign
          land we acknowledge our responsibility to examine and question systems
          of oppression that continue through to the present day and educate
          ourselves about the original stewards of this land.
          <br />
          <br />
          * We also want to acknowledge the Haudenosaunee ironworkers from the
          Six Nations of the Iroquois, mostly from the Mohawk tribe whose labor
          built the many iconic skyscrapers and steel bridges in New York City.
          As recently as 2012 about 200 of the 2,000 structural ironworkers in
          NYC are Mohawk. Every day we view the city skyline of Manhattan we are
          reminded of their contribution.

          Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences,

          disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal

          Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on
          academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations
          of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing
          their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the
          responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their
          discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own
          work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including

        <p>
          Participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up
          with reading, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active
          participation in group work, and attending synchronous sessions
          regularly and on time. Students are expected to keep up with class
          activities and requirements each week.

        <h3>
          Remote Learning Environment Expectations
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to make the most out of remote learning, we need everyone to
          be fully present and ready to engage during synchronous sessions. To
          your best ability, get rid of all the possible distractions in your
          indoor environment such as noise and traffic. Be prepared to zoom into
          every class from an indoor space with strong WiFi. Please don’t zoom
          into a class from your phone while you’re out and about.
          <br /><br />
          Keeping your camera on during class is required for creating a present
          and aware community. If you have special reasons as to why you need to
          keep your camera off please email your instructor to make
          arrangements.
          <br /><br />
          Consider using a task tracking method like sticky notes on a wall, a
          Notion, Trello, Airtable, or other task tracking application to
          organize your to-do list. It’s difficult to stay motivated when you
          work remotely sometimes, so look for tools that would help make it
          easier for you.

        <h3>Recording Synchronous Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          We will be recording our “Open Projector” sessions over Zoom. We will
          be doing this to document student work and for our own assessment and
          evaluation of learning outcomes. The video will not be shared outside
          of the class without explicit permission from the student(s).
        </p>
        <h3>
          Responsibility
        </h3>
        <p>
          Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.
          Late papers, failure to complete the readings assigned for class
          discussion, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and
          presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this
          course.
        </p>
        <h3>Delays</h3>
        <p>
          In rare instances, instructors may be delayed for synchronous
          sessions. If they have not joined by the time the session is scheduled
          to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for their arrival.
          In the event that they will miss a session entirely, an announcement
          will be made on Canvas indicating any work that should be completed
          before the next synchronous session..
        </p>
        <h3>Open Source Policy</h3>
        <p>
          You are encouraged to help each other out with programming, but unless
          otherwise specified you must turn in your own work. Initially it is
          expected that you will be coding from scratch without re-using or
          modifying other people’s code. After midterm reuse and modification of
          code will be allowed, but only under very strict terms.
          <br /><br />
          Copying/pasting and reusing code is a key part of the programming
          process, especially while learning. You often learn best by modifying
          working examples rather than starting from scratch. We stand on the
          shoulders of giants; that’s the essence of the open-source philosophy.
          However, there is a very important caveat: any open-source code you
          borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. That is, you must
          include, in your work, the name of the author, the source URL, the
          types of open-source license, and you must make clear which lines of
          code are not yours. If you fail to do this, you will fail the class.
          It is very, very easy to get this right, though, so if you take a
          moment’s time to label your work correctly, you will not have a
          problem. Just be diligent and honest.

          provide feedback for each of their courses through an online survey.
          They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially
          declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where
          students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important
          process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and
          support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators.
          Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course
          and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class
          are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be
          improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be
          difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching
          methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and
          other administrators review course surveys. Instructions are available
          online at
          http://www.newschool.edu/provost/course-evaluations-student-instructions.pdf.
